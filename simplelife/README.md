Simple life is a terrible game that a person and I poorly programmed during summer military school on a TI-84.

I decided it would be fun to learn BASIC V2 by porting it to the C64.

**Disclaimer:** It is full of senstive topics such as death, sucicde, murder, rape, jail, etc. Don't play it if you're sensitive.
